		 <h3>HTML 5.0 </h3>
		 <p> This is the temporary homepage.  It 
		 consists of a basic html 5.0 template, along with some html elements, like headers, 
		 paragraphs, links, etc.  </p>
		 <p> This page also makes use of both div and span tags, which allow us to create styles 
		 for different areas on the page.</p>
		 <h3>CSS 3.0 </h3>
		 <p> We are able to give style to each of the different tags on the page using CSS.  Note that 
		 up in the head we've included a link to a stylesheet called "basic.css".  In the file "basic.css",
		 we define the styles for the different tags on this page. </p>
